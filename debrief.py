        In this study, we are examining the perceived pleasantness of different musical chords.
        In addition to this, we are interested in uncovering the
        specific structural features in the chords that are responsible for driving their pleasantness/unpleasantness. 
        These features could be related to interval size, pitch height, or familiarity, to name only a few. 
        We are also interested in the drivers of individual differences in responses to these chords.
